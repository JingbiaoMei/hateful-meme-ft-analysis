# Original prompt for structured analysis
prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant trained to assist content moderators. Given a problematic meme, for example harmful or hateful, consisting of an image and associated text, your task is to construct a structured explanation that helps a human moderator judge whether the meme violates hate speech policy.

Instructions:

- Carefully analyze both the image and text together.
    
- Provide a structured explanation using this template:
    
Template: {content in text and image} violates {policy category} because {reason}.

- {content}: Highlight specific parts of the meme (words, phrases, visual elements) that contribute to the violation.
    
- {policy category}: The explanation should contain the most appropriate policy that the content violates.
    
- {reason}: Concisely explain why this content violates the policy (e.g., historical context, hate symbol, derogatory implication).

Please strictly follow the template and do not include the curly braces in your response.
