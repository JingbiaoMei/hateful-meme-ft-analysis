It is using a popular meme format where a person expresses concern about something (in this case, a war) and then another person provides a light-hearted and unexpected response. The context of the meme is not about real-world discrimination or inequality, but rather a satirical take on the idea that women are not conscripted into war, which is often a source of concern. The term \"equality\" is used in a general sense to humorously suggest that women should be included in conscription if they want to be considered equal, but this is not meant to be taken seriously in a hateful way. The meme is not making any claim about the real-world implications of gender roles or discrimination, so it does not rise to the level of being hateful.</think>\n<answer>No</answer>",
